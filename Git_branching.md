### Git Branching Strategy

- The main goal of developer would be delivering releases with new changes frequently on time and make customers happy. For this we need to have a efficient branching strategy.
- Lets assume we have a calculator app, in that we need to add a new feature into that.
-
- ### Feature Branch:
  - Instead of making changes in the main branch, we will create a new  feature branch and test new code in this branch, once we are confident to deliver, we simply merge this changes into existing main/master          branch. For multi[le persons we create multiple feature branches.

- ### Release Branch:
  - Any app to deliver to customers instead of building apps from master we build it through release branch, and we deliver this release branch to customers. instead of delivering from master branch because it is       kept for active development and actively changes will be done here. So as we dont need any changes we deliver it from release branch.
